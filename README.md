# LaunchProof

**Build → Inspect → Prove → Ship.**

LaunchProof is an Apache-2.0 software-assurance platform that asks one question:

> **What evidence do we actually have that this software is ready to release?**

LaunchProof combines deterministic repository inspection, application-security analysis, architecture intelligence, normalized scanner evidence, a typed Application Security Graph, versioned controls, Assurance Cases, policy evaluation, deterministic Release Confidence, optional isolated verification, and optional evidence-grounded AI reasoning.

The product is built around three rules:

- **Evidence before AI.**
- **Unknown ≠ Passed.**
- **Never claim verification without evidence.**

## Status

**v1.0.0 release candidate.** LaunchProof is now in the first public-release program. The architecture and product surfaces are implemented; the stable `v1.0.0` tag remains gated on CI, real-machine scanner/runner validation, Windows desktop packaging and the final release checklist.

A capability being implemented does **not** mean LaunchProof proves an application secure. See [`docs/limitations.md`](docs/limitations.md).

## Product surfaces

LaunchProof 1.0 is intentionally multi-surface:

- **Web** — evidence workspace, Showcase Mode and self-hosted reports;
- **Desktop** — Tauri local-repository workflow with a narrow native boundary;
- **CLI / CI** — deterministic analysis, verification, JSON/SARIF and release gating;
- **Docker** — canonical self-hosted web distribution;
- **Senten adapter** — intended architecture, invariants and evidence interchange without coupling either product to the other.

The web UI does not request arbitrary local filesystem access. Local repository analysis belongs to Desktop or CLI.

LaunchProof Core does not depend on the web UI. The web interface, CLI and future clients consume the same normalized report model.

## Safe analysis

Repositories are hostile input. Static analysis:

- does not execute package lifecycle scripts;
- does not install target dependencies;
- does not run tests or builds;
- does not execute repository binaries;
- does not build target Dockerfiles;
- skips symlinks;
- constrains file count, file size, total text size and traversal depth;
- redacts detected secret values from normalized evidence.

Dynamic verification is separate and requires both policy configuration and explicit invocation authorization. The Docker runner uses a read-only source mount, dropped capabilities, `no-new-privileges`, resource limits, timeout, bounded output, temporary filesystems and network-off by default.

## Certainty

- `DETECTED`: LaunchProof directly observed a structural fact or scanner result.
- `INFERRED`: LaunchProof deterministically correlated evidence into a supported conclusion.
- `VERIFIED`: an explicitly authorized deterministic verification capable of exercising the guarantee completed in an isolated runner.

Static source indicators never become `VERIFIED` merely because they look convincing.

## Quick start

Node.js 24 LTS is the release baseline. Node.js 26 is also supported and is exercised as the forward-compatibility CI lane.
For release-candidate verification from Windows Command Prompt, run `node scripts\verify-release.mjs --bootstrap` on the first clean checkout.

```bash
npm ci --ignore-scripts
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run cli -- analyze scenarios/production-reference
npm run dev -w @launchproof/web
```

Analyzing a repository never installs that repository's dependencies.

### CLI

```bash
launchproof analyze .
launchproof analyze . --json .launchproof/report.json
launchproof analyze . --sarif .launchproof/report.sarif
launchproof analyze . --scanner semgrep-json:semgrep.json
launchproof verify .
launchproof verify . --allow-execution
launchproof report .launchproof/report.json
launchproof report .launchproof/report.json --format sarif
```

`verify --allow-execution` is required before policy-configured dynamic commands may run. A configured allowlisted container image is also required.

Exit codes for `verify`:

- `0`: READY
- `1`: READY_WITH_CONDITIONS or REVIEW_REQUIRED
- `2`: BLOCKED or INCOMPLETE
- `3`: invocation/configuration/analysis error

## Scanner adapters

LaunchProof normalizes outputs from mature tools instead of pretending to replace them:

- Semgrep → code/security findings;
- Gitleaks → redacted secret findings;
- OSV → dependency advisories;
- Trivy → dependency/container/secret findings.

The adapters ingest scanner outputs. Scanner execution itself belongs in CI or the explicit isolated-runner boundary.

## Assurance Cases

Initial first-class cases include authentication/authorization, tenant isolation, secrets, dependency integrity, testable guarantees, production readiness, AI governance and release provenance.

Example:

```text
Users cannot cross tenant boundaries
      ↓
LP-03 Authorization + LP-04 Tenant Isolation + LP-12 Tests
      ↓
route authorization + tenant scope + RLS + security-test evidence
      ↓
SUPPORTED
      ↓
VERIFIED only after deterministic isolated cross-tenant verification
```

## Showcase Mode

The hosted-compatible Showcase UI currently exposes only server-authorized targets:

- Pipeline — Production Reference
- Pipeline — Missing Tenant Authorization
- LaunchProof — Self Analysis
- Senten — Integration Contract

The controlled regression removes real authorization source from the fixture. The before/after view compares changed controls, Assurance Cases, findings and evidence rather than animating a fabricated score.

## AI / BYOM

LaunchProof works without AI. Provider adapters exist for OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Ollama and OpenAI-compatible endpoints. Repository context transmission is governed by:

- `evidence-only`;
- `relevant-context`;
- `extended-context`;
- `local-only`.

Repository text is treated as untrusted prompt data. AI output cannot alter controls, Assurance Case states or release gates.

## Docker

Docker is the canonical self-hosted web distribution:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

The web container is read-only, drops Linux capabilities and uses `no-new-privileges`. Dynamic target execution is not performed inside the web container.

## Desktop

`apps/desktop` contains the Tauri 2 shell. The webview receives only minimal core permissions and narrow native commands. Raw process/filesystem/credential powers are not granted to the webview. Desktop analysis remains architecturally delegated to LaunchProof Core rather than reimplemented in Rust.

```

## Verification

Before a release claim, run:

```bash
npm run format:check
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm test
npm run test:e2e
npm run build -w @launchproof/web
docker build .
npm run cli -- analyze . --json .launchproof/self-report.json
```

If any command cannot run, that limitation must be reported rather than converted into a pass.

## Open source

License: Apache-2.0. LaunchProof Core does not require a LaunchProof account, LaunchProof cloud, a commercial model API, or external source-code transmission.

## ThomasDSCX Labs

LaunchProof is a flagship ThomasDSCX Labs project. Any public badge/report must reference a specific commit or controlled snapshot, analysis version and date. It is release evidence, **not permanent security certification**.

## Extensibility and Senten

LaunchProof Core is platform-agnostic. v1 defines versioned language/framework/platform/evidence-importer contracts rather than teaching Core about every ecosystem. Senten is the first official platform adapter: LaunchProof can detect `senten.architecture.json`, render intended architecture/invariants, and import commit-bound `launchproof-evidence/v1` artifacts without trusting Senten to mark LaunchProof controls as passed. See [`docs/senten-integration.md`](docs/senten-integration.md).

LaunchProof Desktop also exposes a narrow allowlisted native-operation bridge for Senten/Git/Docker diagnostics. It deliberately does **not** expose a free-form terminal or arbitrary shell execution to the webview.


## Release candidate gate

LaunchProof intentionally does not claim a stable 1.0 release merely because features are implemented. The exact release commit must pass the Node 24/26 matrix, browser/E2E, Docker, scanner-ingestion, isolated-runner, Senten, Windows desktop and distribution checkpoints.

See:

- [Release verification](docs/release-verification.md)
- [v1 release checklist](docs/v1-release-checklist.md)
- [Known limitations](docs/limitations.md)
- [Security policy](SECURITY.md)

The stable `v1.0.0` tag is a HUMAN_GATE.
